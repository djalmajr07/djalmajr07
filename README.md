# Data Science

I am a data scientist experienced in developing business solutions end-to-end , from collecting data and creating Machine Learning models and finally implementing.
I have developed regression and classification problems. The details of each one of them are below.

Analytical tools:
- Data Collection: MySQL, Postgres.
- Data Manipulation: Python, Pandas.
- Data Visualization, Deploy and Cloud with Heroku.
- Exploratory Data Analysis with Numpy, Seaborn and Pyplot.
- Data Preparation and Feature Selection with Boruta, Random Forest.
- Machine Learning: KNN, XGBoost, Naive Bayes etc.

## Data Science Projects

[Rossmann Sales](https://github.com/djalmajr07/rossmann-sales)

The CFO requests the prediction of each store in a monthly meeting, whereas she was having difficulty to find out the best investment value for the renovations of each store, due the prediction provided by the directors was not assertive, there was a lot of divergence. Therefore to solve this problem, I used Machine Learning algorithms to forecast most precisely how would be the store prediction for the next six weeks (forty-two days).   

[Insurance All](https://github.com/djalmajr07/InsuranceAll)

![insurance](https://github.com/djalmajr07/InsuranceAll/blob/main/img/capa.jpg)

Insurance All is a company that provides health insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering a new product: Car insurance.
As with health insurance, customers of this new car insurance plan must pay an amount annually to Insurance All in order to obtain an amount insured by the company, intended for the costs of an eventual accident or damage to the vehicle.

Insurance All surveyed nearly 380,000 customers about interest in joining a new auto insurance product last year. All customers showed interest or not in purchasing auto insurance and these responses were saved in a database along with other customer attributes.

The product team selected 127,000 new customers who did not respond to the survey to participate in a campaign, in which they will receive an offer of the new car insurance product. The offer will be made by the sales team through phone calls.
However, the sales team has the capacity to make 20,000 calls within the campaign period.

[All In Insiders](https://github.com/djalmajr07/all_in_insiders)

All in One Place is a multi-brand 'outlet' company that sells second-line products from different brands at a lower price through an 'e-commerce'.

In just over 1 year of operation, the marketing team realized that some customers from its base buy more expensive products, with high frequency and end up contributing a significant portion of the company's revenue.
Based on this perception, the marketing team will launch a `loyalty program` for the best customers in the base, called `Insiders`. But the team does not have the advanced knowledge in data analysis to elect program participants.
For this reason, the marketing team asked the data team to select a selection of eligible customers for the program, using advanced data manipulation techniques.


[Airbnb](https://github.com/djalmajr07/airbnb)

New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand.

In this business case, you are given a list of users along with their demographics, web session records, and some summary statistics. You are asked to predict which country a new user's first booking destination will be. All the users in this dataset are from the USA.


[StarJeans](https://github.com/djalmajr07/starjeans)

Eduardo and Marcelo are two Brazilians, friends and business partners. After several successful business, they are planning to enter the fashion market in US as an E-commerce business model. The initial idea is to enter the market with just one product and for a specific audience, in this case the product would be Jeans for the male audience. The objective is to maintain the operating cost low and scale as they get customers. However, even with the input product and audience defined, the two partners do not have experience in this fashion market and therefore they don't know how to define basic things like price, the type of pants and the material for the manufacture of each piece. The main competitors of Star Jeans company are the American companies H&M and Macys.
