The CFO requests the prediction of each store in a monthly meeting, whereas she was having difficulty to find out the best investment value for the renovations of each store, due the prediction provided by the directors was not assertive, there was a lot of divergence. Therefore to solve this problem, I used Machine Learning algorithms to forecast most precisely how would be the store prediction for the next six weeks (forty-two days).   

[Insurance All](https://github.com/djalmajr07/InsuranceAll)

Insurance All is a company that provides health insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering a new product: Car insurance.
As with health insurance, customers of this new car insurance plan must pay an amount annually to Insurance All in order to obtain an amount insured by the company, intended for the costs of an eventual accident or damage to the vehicle.

Insurance All surveyed nearly 380,000 customers about interest in joining a new auto insurance product last year. All customers showed interest or not in purchasing auto insurance and these responses were saved in a database along with other customer attributes.

The product team selected 127,000 new customers who did not respond to the survey to participate in a campaign, in which they will receive an offer of the new car insurance product. The offer will be made by the sales team through phone calls.
However, the sales team has the capacity to make 20,000 calls within the campaign period.
